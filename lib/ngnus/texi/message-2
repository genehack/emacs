News Headers
============

`message-required-news-headers' a list of header symbols.  These
headers will either be automatically generated, or, if that's
impossible, they will be prompted for.  The following symbols are
valid:


`From'
     This required header will be filled out with the result of the
     `message-make-from' function, which depends on the
     `message-from-style', `user-full-name',
     `user-mail-address' variables.

`Subject'
     This required header will be prompted for if not present already.

`Newsgroups'
     This required header says which newsgroups the article is to be
     posted to.  If it isn't present already, it will be prompted for.

`Organization'
     This optional header will be filled out depending on the
     `message-user-organization' variable.
     `message-user-organization-file' will be used if this variable is
     `t'.  This variable can also be a string (in which case this
     string will be used), or it can be a function (which will be
     called with no parameters and should return a string to be used).

`Lines'
     This optional header will be computed by Message.

`Message-ID'
     This required header will be generated by Message.  A unique ID
     will be created based on the date, time, user name (for the local
     part) and the domain part.  For the domain part, message will
     look (in this order) at `message-user-fqdn', `system-name',
     `mail-host-address' and `message-user-mail-address'
     (i.e. `user-mail-address') until a probably valid fully qualified
     domain name (FQDN) was found.

`User-Agent'
     This optional header will be filled out according to the
     `message-newsreader' local variable.

`In-Reply-To'
     This optional header is filled out using the `Date' and `From'
     header of the article being replied to.

`Expires'
     This extremely optional header will be inserted according to the
     `message-expires' variable.  It is highly deprecated and
     shouldn't be used unless you know what you're doing.

`Distribution'
     This optional header is filled out according to the
     `message-distribution-function' variable.  It is a deprecated and
     much misunderstood header.

`Path'
     This extremely optional header should probably never be used.
     However, some *very* old servers require that this header is
     present.  `message-user-path' further controls how this `Path'
     header is to look.  If it is `nil', use the server name as the
     leaf node.  If it is a string, use the string.  If it is neither
     a string nor `nil', use the user name only.  However, it is
     highly unlikely that you should need to fiddle with this variable
     at all.

In addition, you can enter conses into this list.  The CAR of this cons
should be a symbol.  This symbol's name is the name of the header, and
the CDR can either be a string to be entered verbatim as the value of
this header, or it can be a function to be called.  This function should
return a string to be inserted.  For instance, if you want to insert
`Mime-Version: 1.0', you should enter `(Mime-Version . "1.0")'
into the list.  If you want to insert a funny quote, you could enter
something like `(X-Yow . yow)' into the list.  The function
`yow' will then be called without any arguments.

If the list contains a cons where the CAR of the cons is `optional',
the CDR of this cons will only be inserted if it is non-`nil'.

If you want to delete an entry from this list, the following Lisp
snippet might be useful.  Adjust accordingly if you want to remove
another element.

     (setq message-required-news-headers
           (delq 'Message-ID message-required-news-headers))

Other variables for customizing outgoing news articles:


`message-syntax-checks'
     Controls what syntax checks should not be performed on outgoing
     posts.  To disable checking of long signatures, for instance, add

          (signature . disabled)

     to this list.

     Valid checks are:

     `approved'
          Check whether the article has an `Approved' header, which is
          something only moderators should include.
     `continuation-headers'
          Check whether there are continuation header lines that don't
          begin with whitespace.
     `control-chars'
          Check for invalid characters.
     `empty'
          Check whether the article is empty.
     `existing-newsgroups'
          Check whether the newsgroups mentioned in the `Newsgroups' and
          `Followup-To' headers exist.
     `from'
          Check whether the `From' header seems nice.
     `illegible-text'
          Check whether there is any non-printable character in the
          body.
     `invisible-text'
          Check whether there is any invisible text in the buffer.
     `long-header-lines'
          Check for too long header lines.
     `long-lines'
          Check for too long lines in the body.
     `message-id'
          Check whether the `Message-ID' looks syntactically ok.
     `multiple-headers'
          Check for the existence of multiple equal headers.
     `new-text'
          Check whether there is any new text in the messages.
     `newsgroups'
          Check whether the `Newsgroups' header exists and is not
          empty.
     `quoting-style'
          Check whether text follows last quoted portion.
     `repeated-newsgroups'
          Check whether the `Newsgroups' and `Followup-to' headers
          contains repeated group names.
     `reply-to'
          Check whether the `Reply-To' header looks ok.
     `sender'
          Insert a new `Sender' header if the `From' header looks odd.
     `sendsys'
          Check for the existence of version and sendsys commands.
     `shoot'
          Check whether the domain part of the `Message-ID' header
          looks ok.
     `shorten-followup-to'
          Check whether to add a `Followup-to' header to shorten the
          number of groups to post to.
     `signature'
          Check the length of the signature.
     `size'
          Check for excessive size.
     `subject'
          Check whether the `Subject' header exists and is not empty.
     `subject-cmsg'
          Check the subject for commands.
     `valid-newsgroups'
          Check whether the `Newsgroups' and `Followup-to' headers are
          valid syntactically.

     All these conditions are checked by default, except for `sender'
     for which the check is disabled by default if
     `message-insert-canlock' is non-`nil' (*Note Canceling News::).

`message-ignored-news-headers'
     Regexp of headers to be removed before posting.  The default is
     `^NNTP-Posting-Host:\\|^Xref:\\|^[BGF]cc:\\|^Resent-Fcc:\\|
     ^X-Draft-From:\\|^X-Gnus-Agent-Meta-Information:'.

`message-default-news-headers'
     This string is inserted at the end of the headers in all message
     buffers that are initialized as news.





File: message, Node: News Variables, Next: Insertion Variables, Prev: News Headers, Up: Variables

News Variables
==============

`message-send-news-function'
     Function used to send the current buffer as news.  The default is
     `message-send-news'.

`message-post-method'
     Gnusish "select method" (see the Gnus manual for details) used
     for posting a prepared news message.





File: message, Node: Insertion Variables, Next: Various Message Variables, Prev: News Variables, Up: Variables

Insertion Variables
===================

`message-ignored-cited-headers'
     All headers that match this regexp will be removed from yanked
     messages.  The default is `.', which means that all headers will
     be removed.

`message-cite-prefix-regexp'
     Regexp matching the longest possible citation prefix on a line.

`message-citation-line-function'
     Function called to insert the citation line.  The default is
     `message-insert-citation-line', which will lead to citation lines
     that look like:

          Hallvard B Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no> writes:


     Point will be at the beginning of the body of the message when
     this function is called.

     Note that Gnus provides a feature where clicking on `writes:'
     hides the cited text.  If you change the citation line too much,
     readers of your messages will have to adjust their Gnus, too.
     See the variable `gnus-cite-attribution-suffix'.  *Note Article
     Highlighting: (gnus)Article Highlighting, for details.

`message-yank-prefix'
     When you are replying to or following up an article, you normally want
     to quote the person you are answering.  Inserting quoted text is done by
     "yanking", and each line you yank will have
     `message-yank-prefix' prepended to it (except for quoted lines
     which use `message-yank-cited-prefix' and empty lines which use
     `message-yank-empty-prefix').  The default is `> '.

`message-yank-cited-prefix'
     When yanking text from an article which contains already cited
     text, each line will be prefixed with the contents of this
     variable.  The default is `>'.  See also `message-yank-prefix'.

`message-yank-empty-prefix'
     When yanking text from an article, each empty line will be
     prefixed with the contents of this variable.  The default is `>'.
     You can set this variable to an empty string to split the cited
     text into paragraphs automatically.  See also
     `message-yank-prefix'.

`message-indentation-spaces'
     Number of spaces to indent yanked messages.

`message-cite-function'
     Function for citing an original message.  The default is
     `message-cite-original', which simply inserts the original
     message and prepends `> ' to each line.
     `message-cite-original-without-signature' does the same, but
     elides the signature.  You can also set it to `sc-cite-original'
     to use Supercite.

`message-indent-citation-function'
     Function for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail
     buffer.  This can also be a list of functions.  Each function can
     find the citation between `(point)' and `(mark t)'.  And each
     function should leave point and mark around the citation text as
     modified.

`message-mark-insert-begin'
     String to mark the beginning of some inserted text.

`message-mark-insert-end'
     String to mark the end of some inserted text.

`message-signature'
     String to be inserted at the end of the message buffer.  If `t'
     (which is the default), the `message-signature-file' file will be
     inserted instead.  If a function, the result from the function
     will be used instead.  If a form, the result from the form will
     be used instead.  If this variable is `nil', no signature will be
     inserted at all.

`message-signature-file'
     File containing the signature to be inserted at the end of the
     buffer.  If a path is specified, the value of
     `message-signature-directory' is ignored, even if set.  The
     default is `~/.signature'.

`message-signature-directory'
     Name of directory containing signature files.  Comes in handy if
     you have many such files, handled via Gnus posting styles for
     instance.  If `nil' (the default), `message-signature-file' is
     expected to specify the directory if needed.


`message-signature-insert-empty-line'
     If `t' (the default value) an empty line is inserted before the
     signature separator.


Note that RFC1036bis says that a signature should be preceded by the
three characters `-- ' on a line by themselves.  This is to make it
easier for the recipient to automatically recognize and process the
signature.  So don't remove those characters, even though you might
feel that they ruin your beautiful design, like, totally.

Also note that no signature should be more than four lines long.
Including ASCII graphics is an efficient way to get everybody to
believe that you are silly and have nothing important to say.




File: message, Node: Various Message Variables, Next: Sending Variables, Prev: Insertion Variables, Up: Variables

Various Message Variables
=========================

`message-default-charset'
     Symbol naming a MIME charset.  Non-ASCII characters in messages
     are assumed to be encoded using this charset.  The default is
     `iso-8859-1' on non-MULE Emacsen; otherwise `nil', which means
     ask the user.  (This variable is used only on non-MULE Emacsen.)
     *Note Charset Translation: (emacs-mime)Charset Translation, for
     details on the MULE-to-MIME translation process.

`message-fill-column'
     Local value for the column beyond which automatic line-wrapping
     should happen for message buffers.  If non-nil (the default),
     also turn on auto-fill in message buffers.

`message-signature-separator'
     Regexp matching the signature separator.  It is `^-- *$' by
     default.

`mail-header-separator'
     String used to separate the headers from the body.  It is `--text
     follows this line--' by default.

`message-directory'
     Directory used by many mailey things.  The default is `~/Mail/'.
     All other mail file variables are derived from
     `message-directory'.

`message-auto-save-directory'
     Directory where Message auto-saves buffers if Gnus isn't running.  If
     `nil', Message won't auto-save.  The default is `~/Mail/drafts/'.

`message-signature-setup-hook'
     Hook run when initializing the message buffer.  It is run after
     the headers have been inserted but before the signature has been
     inserted.

`message-setup-hook'
     Hook run as the last thing when the message buffer has been
     initialized, but before yanked text is inserted.

`message-header-setup-hook'
     Hook called narrowed to the headers after initializing the
     headers.

     For instance, if you're running Gnus and wish to insert a
     `Mail-Copies-To' header in all your news articles and all
     messages you send to mailing lists, you could do something like
     the following:

          (defun my-message-header-setup-hook ()
            (let ((group (or gnus-newsgroup-name "")))
              (when (or (message-fetch-field "newsgroups")
                        (gnus-group-find-parameter group 'to-address)
                        (gnus-group-find-parameter group 'to-list))
                (insert "Mail-Copies-To: never\n"))))

          (add-hook 'message-header-setup-hook
                    'my-message-header-setup-hook)

`message-send-hook'
     Hook run before sending messages.

     If you want to add certain headers before sending, you can use the
     `message-add-header' function in this hook.  For instance:

          (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'my-message-add-content)
          (defun my-message-add-content ()
            (message-add-header "X-In-No-Sense: Nonsense")
            (message-add-header "X-Whatever: no"))

     This function won't add the header if the header is already
     present.

`message-send-mail-hook'
     Hook run before sending mail messages.  This hook is run very
     late -- just before the message is actually sent as mail.

`message-send-news-hook'
     Hook run before sending news messages.  This hook is run very
     late -- just before the message is actually sent as news.

`message-sent-hook'
     Hook run after sending messages.

`message-cancel-hook'
     Hook run when canceling news articles.

`message-mode-syntax-table'
     Syntax table used in message mode buffers.

`message-cite-articles-with-x-no-archive'
     If non-`nil', don't strip quoted text from articles that have
     `X-No-Archive' set.  Even if this variable isn't set, you can
     undo the stripping by hitting the `undo' keystroke.

`message-strip-special-text-properties'
     Emacs has a number of special text properties which can break
     message composing in various ways.  If this option is set,
     message will strip these properties from the message composition
     buffer.  However, some packages requires these properties to be
     present in order to work.  If you use one of these packages, turn
     this option off, and hope the message composition doesn't break
     too bad.

`message-send-method-alist'
     Alist of ways to send outgoing messages.  Each element has the
     form:

          (TYPE PREDICATE FUNCTION)

     TYPE
          A symbol that names the method.

     PREDICATE
          A function called without any parameters to determine
          whether the message is a message of type TYPE.  The function
          will be called in the buffer where the message is.

     FUNCTION
          A function to be called if PREDICATE returns non-`nil'.
          FUNCTION is called with one parameter--the prefix.

     The default is:

          ((news message-news-p message-send-via-news)
           (mail message-mail-p message-send-via-mail))

     The `message-news-p' function returns non-`nil' if the message
     looks like news, and the `message-send-via-news' function sends the
     message according to the `message-send-news-function' variable
     (*Note News Variables::).  The `message-mail-p' function returns
     non-`nil' if the message looks like mail, and the
     `message-send-via-mail' function sends the message according to the
     `message-send-mail-function' variable (*Note Mail Variables::).

     All the elements in this alist will be tried in order, so a
     message containing both a valid `Newsgroups' header and a valid
     `To' header, for example, will be sent as news, and then as mail.





File: message, Node: Sending Variables, Next: Message Buffers, Prev: Various Message Variables, Up: Variables

Sending Variables
=================


`message-fcc-handler-function'
     A function called to save outgoing articles.  This function will
     be called with the name of the file to store the article in.  The
     default function is `message-output' which saves in Unix mailbox
     format.

`message-courtesy-message'
     When sending combined messages, this string is inserted at the
     start of the mailed copy.  If the string contains the format spec
     `%s', the newsgroups the article has been posted to will be
     inserted there.  If this variable is `nil', no such courtesy
     message will be added.  The default value is `"The following
     message is a courtesy copy of an article\\nthat has been posted
     to %s as well.\\n\\n"'.

`message-fcc-externalize-attachments'
     If `nil', attach files as normal parts in Fcc copies; if it is
     non-`nil', attach local files as external parts.

`message-interactive'
     If non-`nil' wait for and display errors when sending a message;
     if `nil' let the mailer mail back a message to report errors.





File: message, Node: Message Buffers, Next: Message Actions, Prev: Sending Variables, Up: Variables

Message Buffers
===============

Message will generate new buffers with unique buffer names when you
request a message buffer.  When you send the message, the buffer isn't
normally killed off.  Its name is changed and a certain number of old
message buffers are kept alive.

`message-generate-new-buffers'
     Controls whether to create a new message buffer to compose a
     message.  Valid values include:

     `nil'
          Generate the buffer name in the Message way (e.g., *mail*,
          *news*, *mail to whom*, *news on group*, etc.) and continue
          editing in the existing buffer of that name.  If there is no
          such buffer, it will be newly created.

     `unique'
     `t'
          Create the new buffer with the name generated in the Message
          way.  This is the default.

     `unsent'
          Similar to `unique' but the buffer name begins with "*unsent
          .

     `standard'
          Similar to `nil' but the buffer name is simpler like *mail
          message*.
     FUNCTION
          If this is a function, call that function with three parameters: The
          type, the To address and the group name (any of these may be
          `nil').  The function should return the new buffer name.

     The default value is `unique'.

`message-max-buffers'
     This variable says how many old message buffers to keep.  If
     there are more message buffers than this, the oldest buffer will
     be killed.  The default is 10.  If this variable is `nil', no old
     message buffers will ever be killed.

`message-send-rename-function'
     After sending a message, the buffer is renamed from, for
     instance, `*reply to Lars*' to `*sent reply to Lars*'.  If you
     don't like this, set this variable to a function that renames the
     buffer in a manner you like.  If you don't want to rename the
     buffer at all, you can say:

          (setq message-send-rename-function 'ignore)

`message-kill-buffer-on-exit'
     If non-`nil', kill the buffer immediately on exit.





File: message, Node: Message Actions, Prev: Message Buffers, Up: Variables

Message Actions
===============

When Message is being used from a news/mail reader, the reader is
likely to want to perform some task after the message has been sent.
Perhaps return to the previous window configuration or mark an article
as replied.

The user may exit from the message buffer in various ways.  The most
common is `C-c C-c', which sends the message and exits.  Other
possibilities are `C-c C-s' which just sends the message, `C-c
C-d' which postpones the message editing and buries the message buffer,
and `C-c C-k' which kills the message buffer.  Each of these actions
have lists associated with them that contains actions to be executed:
`message-send-actions', `message-exit-actions',
`message-postpone-actions', and `message-kill-actions'.

Message provides a function to interface with these lists:
`message-add-action'.  The first parameter is the action to be added,
and the rest of the arguments are which lists to add this action to.
Here's an example from Gnus:

       (message-add-action
        `(set-window-configuration ,(current-window-configuration))
        'exit 'postpone 'kill)

This restores the Gnus window configuration when the message buffer is
killed, postponed or exited.

An "action" can be either: a normal function, or a list where the CAR
is a function and the CDR is the list of arguments, or a form to be
`eval'ed.




File: message, Node: Compatibility, Next: Appendices, Prev: Variables, Up: Top

Compatibility
*************

Message uses virtually only its own variables--older `mail-' variables
aren't consulted.  To force Message to take those variables into
account, you can put the following in your `.emacs' file:

     (require 'messcompat)

This will initialize many Message variables from the values in the
corresponding mail variables.

* Responses::          Standard rules for determining where responses go.




File: message, Node: Responses, Prev: Appendices, Up: Appendices

Responses
=========

To determine where a message is to go, the following algorithm is used
by default.

"reply"
     A "reply" is when you want to respond *just* to the person who
     sent the message via mail.  There will only be one recipient.  To
     determine who the recipient will be, the following headers are
     consulted, in turn:

     `Reply-To'

     `From'


"wide reply"
     A "wide reply" is a mail response that includes *all* entities
     mentioned in the message you are responded to.  All mailboxes from the
     following headers will be concatenated to form the outgoing
     `To'/`Cc' headers:

     `From'
          (unless there's a `Reply-To', in which case that is used
          instead).

     `Cc'

     `To'

     If a `Mail-Copies-To' header is present, it will also be included
     in the list of mailboxes.  If this header is `never', that means
     that the `From' (or `Reply-To') mailbox will be suppressed.


"followup"
     A "followup" is a response sent via news.  The following headers
     (listed in order of precedence) determine where the response is
     to be sent:


     `Followup-To'

     `Newsgroups'


     If a `Mail-Copies-To' header is present, it will be used as the
     basis of the new `Cc' header, except if this header is
     `never'.

GNU Free Documentation License
******************************
                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
     other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
     freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
     redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
     commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
     preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft," which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
     copyleft license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a
     notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
     duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
     The "Document," below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
     member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you."
     You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
     in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
     the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the
     Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
     none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
     may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
     copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
     the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
     to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque."


     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats
     include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary
     formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
     are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
     PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
     itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
     the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
     For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
     Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
     the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
     text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
     parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
     language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
     below, such as "Acknowledgements," "Dedications," "Endorsements,"
     or "History.")  To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
     you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
     XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
     in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any
     other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is
     void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
     you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
     You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
     reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
     However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If
     you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
     follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
     clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
     copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
     words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
     limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
     Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
     copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
     from which the general network-using public has access to
     download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you
     use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
     when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
     ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
     the stated location until at least one year after the last time
     you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
     of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
     to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
     these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
        of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
        and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled "History," Preserve its Title, and add
        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
        there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
        it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications,"
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
        the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
        and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements."  Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
        or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
     this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
     Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
     from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements," provided it
     contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
     various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
     the text has been approved by an organization as the
     authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If
     the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
     to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
     single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
     same name but different contents, make the title of each such
     section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
     name of the original author or publisher of that section if
     known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
     notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     Acknowledgements," and any sections Entitled "Dedications."  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single
     copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
     the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you
     insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
     follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
     copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  When the Document is included in an
     aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
     aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the
     Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
     or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
     electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
     that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
     section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
     requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you
     may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
     addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
     You may include a translation of this License, and all the
     license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
     provided that you also include the original English version of
     this License and the original versions of those notices and
     disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the translation
     and the original version of this License or a notice or
     disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements,"
     Dedications," or "History," the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
     the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.



ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
     Free Documentation License."

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
