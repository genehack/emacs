Question 6.1
............

How to import my old mail into Gnus?


Answer
......

The easiest way is to tell your old mail program to
export the messages in mbox format. Most Unix mailers
are able to do this, if you come from the MS Windows
world, you may find tools at
`http://mbx2mbox.sourceforge.net/'.

Now you've got to import this mbox file into Gnus. To do
this, create a nndoc group based on the mbox file by
saying `G f /path/file.mbox RET' in
Group buffer. You now have read-only access to your
mail. If you want to import the messages to your normal
Gnus mail groups hierarchy, enter the nndoc group you've
just created by saying `C-u RET'
(thus making sure all messages are retrieved), mark all
messages by saying `M P b' and
either copy them to the desired group by saying
`B c name.of.group RET' or send them
through nnmail-split-methods (respool them) by saying
`B r'.

Question 6.2
............

How to archive interesting messages?


Answer
......

If you stumble across an interesting message, say in gnu.emacs.gnus
and want to archive it there are several solutions. The first and
easiest is to save it to a file by saying `O f'. However, wouldn't it
be much more convenient to have more direct access to the archived
message from Gnus? If you say yes, put this snippet by Frank Haun
<pille3003@fhaun.de> in ~/.gnus.el:

     (defun my-archive-article (&optional n)
       "Copies one or more article(s) to a corresponding `nnml:' group, e.g.
     `gnus.ding' goes to `nnml:1.gnus.ding'. And `nnml:List-gnus.ding' goes
     to `nnml:1.List-gnus-ding'.

     Use process marks or mark a region in the summary buffer to archive
     more then one article."
       (interactive "P")
       (let ((archive-name
              (format
               "nnml:1.%s"
               (if (featurep 'xemacs)
                   (replace-in-string gnus-newsgroup-name "^.*:" "")
                 (replace-regexp-in-string "^.*:" "" gnus-newsgroup-name)))))
         (gnus-summary-copy-article n archive-name)))
@noindent

You can now say `M-x my-archive-article' in summary buffer to archive
the article under the cursor in a nnml group. (Change nnml to your
preferred back end)

Of course you can also make sure the cache is enabled by saying

     (setq gnus-use-cache t)
@noindent

then you only have to set either the tick or the dormant mark for
articles you want to keep, setting the read mark will remove them from
cache.



File: gnus, Node: [6.3]

Question 6.3
............

How to search for a specific message?


Answer
......

There are several ways for this, too. For a posting from
a Usenet group the easiest solution is probably to ask
groups.google.com (http://groups.google.com),
if you found the posting there, tell Google to display
the raw message, look for the message-id, and say
`M-^ the@message.id RET' in a
summary buffer.
Since Gnus 5.10 there's also a Gnus interface for
groups.google.com which you can call with
`G W') in group buffer.

Another idea which works for both mail and news groups is to enter the
group where the message you are searching is and use the standard
Emacs search `C-s', it's smart enough to look at articles in collapsed
threads, too. If you want to search bodies, too try `M-s'
instead. Further on there are the gnus-summary-limit-to-foo functions,
which can help you, too.

Of course you can also use grep to search through your local mail, but
this is both slow for big archives and inconvenient since you are not
displaying the found mail in Gnus. Here comes nnir into action. Nnir
is a front end to search engines like swish-e or swish++ and
others. You index your mail with one of those search engines and with
the help of nnir you can search trough the indexed mail and generate a
temporary group with all messages which met your search criteria. If
this sound cool to you get nnir.el from
`ftp://ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/src/emacs/' or
`ftp://ftp.is.informatik.uni-duisburg.de/pub/src/emacs/'.
Instructions on how to use it are at the top of the file.

Question 6.4
............

How to get rid of old unwanted mail?


Answer
......

You can of course just mark the mail you don't need anymore by saying
`#' with point over the mail and then say `B DEL' to get rid of them
forever. You could also instead of actually deleting them, send them
to a junk-group by saying `B m nnml:trash-bin' which you clear from
time to time, but both are not the intended way in Gnus.

In Gnus, we let mail expire like news expires on a news server. That
means you tell Gnus the message is expirable (you tell Gnus "I don't
need this mail anymore") by saying `E' with point over the mail in
summary buffer. Now when you leave the group, Gnus looks at all
messages which you marked as expirable before and if they are old
enough (default is older than a week) they are deleted.



File: gnus, Node: [6.5]

Question 6.5
............

I want that all read messages are expired (at least in some
groups). How to do it?


Answer
......

If you want all read messages to be expired (e.g. in mailing lists
where there's an online archive), you've got two choices: auto-expire
and total-expire. Auto-expire means, that every article which has no
marks set and is selected for reading is marked as expirable, Gnus
hits `E' for you every time you read a message. Total-expire follows a
slightly different approach, here all article where the read mark is
set are expirable.

To activate auto-expire, include auto-expire in the Group parameters
for the group. (Hit `G c' in summary buffer with point over the group
to change group parameters). For total-expire add total-expire to the
group-parameters.

Which method you choose is merely a matter of taste: Auto-expire is
faster, but it doesn't play together with Adaptive Scoring, so if you
want to use this feature, you should use total-expire.

If you want a message to be excluded from expiration in
a group where total or auto expire is active, set either
tick (hit `u') or dormant mark (hit
`u'), when you use auto-expire, you
can also set the read mark (hit
`d').



File: gnus, Node: [6.6]

Question 6.6
............

I don't want expiration to delete my mails but to move them to another
group.


Answer
......

Say something like this in ~/.gnus.el:

     (setq nnmail-expiry-target "nnml:expired")
@noindent

(If you want to change the value of nnmail-expiry-target on a per
group basis see the question "How can I disable threading in some
(e.g. mail-) groups, or set other variables specific for some
groups?")

File: gnus, Node: [7.1]

Question 7.1
............

I don't have a permanent connection to the net, how can I minimize the
time I've got to be connected?


Answer
......

You've got basically two options: Either you use the Gnus Agent (see
below) for this, or you can install programs which fetch your news and
mail to your local disk and Gnus reads the stuff from your local
machine.

If you want to follow the second approach, you need a program which
fetches news and offers them to Gnus, a program which does the same
for mail and a program which receives the mail you write from Gnus and
sends them when you're online.

Let's talk about Unix systems first: For the news part,
the easiest solution is a small nntp server like
Leafnode (http://www.leafnode.org/) or
sn (http://infa.abo.fi/~patrik/sn/),
of course you can also install a full featured news
server like
inn (http://www.isc.org/products/INN/).
Then you want to fetch your Mail, popular choices
are fetchmail (http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/)
and getmail (http://www.qcc.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-3.0/).
You should tell those to write the mail to your disk and
Gnus to read it from there. Last but not least the mail
sending part: This can be done with every MTA like
sendmail (http://www.sendmail.org/),
postfix (http://www.qmail.org/),
exim (http://www.exim.org/) or
qmail (http://www.qmail.org/).

On windows boxes I'd vote for Hamster (http://www.tglsoft.de/), it's a
small freeware, open-source program which fetches your mail and news
from remote servers and offers them to Gnus (or any other mail and/or
news reader) via nntp respectively POP3 or IMAP. It also includes a
smtp server for receiving mails from Gnus.



File: gnus, Node: [7.2]

Question 7.2
............

So what was this thing about the Agent?


Answer
......

The Gnus agent is part of Gnus, it allows you to fetch mail and news
and store them on disk for reading them later when you're offline. It
kind of mimics offline newsreaders like e.g. Forte Agent. If you want
to use the Agent place the following in ~/.gnus.el if you are still
using 5.8.8 or 5.9 (it's the default since 5.10):

     (setq gnus-agent t)
@noindent

Now you've got to select the servers whose groups can be stored
locally.  To do this, open the server buffer (that is press `^' while
in the group buffer).  Now select a server by moving point to the line
naming that server.  Finally, agentize the server by typing `J a'.  If
you make a mistake, or change your mind, you can undo this action by
typing `J r'.  When you're done, type 'q' to return to the group
buffer.  Now the next time you enter a group on a agentized server,
the headers will be stored on disk and read from there the next time
you enter the group.



File: gnus, Node: [7.3]

Question 7.3
............

I want to store article bodies on disk, too. How to do it?


Answer
......

You can tell the agent to automatically fetch the bodies of articles
which fulfill certain predicates, this is done in a special buffer
which can be reached by saying `J c' in group buffer. Please refer to
the documentation for information which predicates are possible and
how exactly to do it.

Further on you can tell the agent manually which articles to store on
disk. There are two ways to do this: Number one: In the summary
buffer, process mark a set of articles that shall be stored in the
agent by saying `#' with point over the article and then type `J
s'. The other possibility is to set, again in the summary buffer,
downloadable (%) marks for the articles you want by typing `@' with
point over the article and then typing `J u'.  What's the difference?
Well, process marks are erased as soon as you exit the summary buffer
while downloadable marks are permanent.  You can actually set
downloadable marks in several groups then use fetch session ('J s' in
the GROUP buffer) to fetch all of those articles.  The only downside
is that fetch session also fetches all of the headers for every
selected group on an agentized server.  Depending on the volume of
headers, the initial fetch session could take hours.



File: gnus, Node: [7.4]

Question 7.4
............

How to tell Gnus not to try to send mails / postings while I'm
offline?


Answer
......

All you've got to do is to tell Gnus when you are online (plugged) and
when you are offline (unplugged), the rest works automatically. You
can toggle plugged/unplugged state by saying `J j' in group buffer. To
start Gnus unplugged say `M-x gnus-unplugged' instead of `M-x
gnus'. Note that for this to work, the agent must be active.

Question 8.1
............

How to find information and help inside Emacs?


Answer
......

The first stop should be the Gnus manual (Say `C-h i d m Gnus RET' to
start the Gnus manual, then walk through the menus or do a full-text
search with `s'). Then there are the general Emacs help commands
starting with C-h, type `C-h ? ?' to get a list of all available help
commands and their meaning. Finally `M-x apropos-command' lets you
search through all available functions and `M-x apropos' searches the
bound variables.



File: gnus, Node: [8.2]

Question 8.2
............

I can't find anything in the Gnus manual about X (e.g. attachments,
PGP, MIME...), is it not documented?


Answer
......

There's not only the Gnus manual but also the manuals for message,
emacs-mime, sieve and pgg. Those packages are distributed with Gnus
and used by Gnus but aren't really part of core Gnus, so they are
documented in different info files, you should have a look in those
manuals, too.



File: gnus, Node: [8.3]

Question 8.3
............

Which websites should I know?


Answer
......

The two most important ones are the official Gnus website
(http://www.gnus.org).  and it's sister site my.gnus.org (MGO)
(http://my.gnus.org), hosting an archive of lisp snippets, howtos, a
(not really finished) tutorial and this FAQ.

Tell me about other sites which are interesting.



File: gnus, Node: [8.4]

Question 8.4
............

Which mailing lists and newsgroups are there?


Answer
......

There's the newsgroup gnu.emacs.gnus (also available as
gmane.emacs.gnus.user (http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.user))
which deals with general Gnus questions.  If you have questions about
development versions of Gnus, you should better ask on the ding
mailing list, see below.

If you want to stay in the big8, news.software.newssreaders is also
read by some Gnus users (but chances for qualified help are much
better in the above groups). If you speak German, there's
de.comm.software.gnus.

The ding mailing list (ding@gnus.org) deals with development of
Gnus. You can read the ding list via NNTP, too under the name
gmane.emacs.gnus.general
(http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general) from news.gmane.org.

File: gnus, Node: [9.1]

Question 9.1
............

Starting Gnus is really slow, how to speed it up?


Answer
......

The reason for this could be the way Gnus reads it's active file, see
the node "The Active File" in the Gnus manual for things you might try
to speed the process up.  An other idea would be to byte compile your
~/.gnus.el (say `M-x byte-compile-file RET ~/.gnus.el RET' to do
it). Finally, if you have require statements in your .gnus, you could
replace them with eval-after-load, which loads the stuff not at
startup time, but when it's needed. Say you've got this in your
~/.gnus.el:

     (require 'message)
     (add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled))
@noindent

then as soon as you start Gnus, message.el is loaded. If you replace
it with

     (eval-after-load "message"
           '(add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled)))
@noindent

it's loaded when it's needed.



File: gnus, Node: [9.2]

Question 9.2
............

How to speed up the process of entering a group?


Answer
......

A speed killer is setting the variable gnus-fetch-old-headers to
anything different from nil, so don't do this if speed is an issue. To
speed up building of summary say

     (gnus-compile)
@noindent

at the bottom of your ~/.gnus.el, this will make gnus byte-compile
things like gnus-summary-line-format.  then you could increase the
value of gc-cons-threshold by saying something like

     (setq gc-cons-threshold 3500000)
@noindent

in ~/.emacs. If you don't care about width of CJK characters or use
Gnus 5.10 or younger together with a recent GNU Emacs, you should say

     (setq gnus-use-correct-string-widths nil)
@noindent

in ~/.gnus.el (thanks to Jesper harder for the last two
suggestions). Finally if you are still using 5.8.8 or 5.9 and
experience speed problems with summary buffer generation, you
definitely should update to 5.10 since there quite some work on
improving it has been done.



File: gnus, Node: [9.3]

Question 9.3
............

Sending mail becomes slower and slower, what's up?


Answer
......

The reason could be that you told Gnus to archive the messages you
wrote by setting gnus-message-archive-group. Try to use a nnml group
instead of an archive group, this should bring you back to normal
speed.

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
     other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
     freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
     redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
     commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
     preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft," which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
     copyleft license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a
     notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
     duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
     The "Document," below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
     member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you."
     You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
     in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
     the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the
     Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
     none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
     may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
     copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
     the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
     to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque."


     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats
     include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary
     formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
     are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
     PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
     itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
     the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
     For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
     Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
     the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
     text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
     parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
     language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
     below, such as "Acknowledgements," "Dedications," "Endorsements,"
     or "History.")  To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
     you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
     XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
     in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any
     other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is
     void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
     you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
     You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
     reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
     However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If
     you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
     follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
     clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
     copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
     words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
     limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
     Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
     copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
     from which the general network-using public has access to
     download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you
     use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
     when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
     ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
     the stated location until at least one year after the last time
     you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
     of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
     to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
     these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
        of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
        and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled "History," Preserve its Title, and add
        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
        there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
        it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications,"
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
        the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
        and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements."  Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
        or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
     this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
     Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
     from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements," provided it
     contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
     various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
     the text has been approved by an organization as the
     authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If
     the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
     to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
     single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
     same name but different contents, make the title of each such
     section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
     name of the original author or publisher of that section if
     known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
     notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     Acknowledgements," and any sections Entitled "Dedications."  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single
     copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
     the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you
     insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
     follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
     copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  When the Document is included in an
     aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
     aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the
     Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
     or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
     electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
     that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
     section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
     requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you
     may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
     addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
     You may include a translation of this License, and all the
     license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
     provided that you also include the original English version of
     this License and the original versions of those notices and
     disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the translation
     and the original version of this License or a notice or
     disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements,"
     Dedications," or "History," the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
     the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.



ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
     Free Documentation License."

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
