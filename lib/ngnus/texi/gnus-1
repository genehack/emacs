Starting Gnus
*************

If you haven't used Emacs much before using Gnus, read *Note Emacs for
Heathens:: first.

If your system administrator has set things up properly, starting Gnus
and reading news is extremely easy--you just type `M-x gnus' in
your Emacs.  If not, you should customize the variable
`gnus-select-method' as described in *Note Finding the News::.  For a
minimal setup for posting should also customize the variables
`user-full-name' and `user-mail-address'.

If you want to start Gnus in a different frame, you can use the command
`M-x gnus-other-frame' instead.

If things do not go smoothly at startup, you have to twiddle some
variables in your `~/.gnus.el' file.  This file is similar to
`~/.emacs', but is read when Gnus starts.

If you puzzle at any terms used in this manual, please refer to the
terminology section (*Note Terminology::).

* Finding the News::      Choosing a method for getting news.
* The First Time::        What does Gnus do the first time you start it?

File: gnus, Node: Finding the News, Next: The First Time, Prev: Starting Up, Up: Starting Up

Finding the News
================

The `gnus-select-method' variable says where Gnus should look for
news.  This variable should be a list where the first element says
how" and the second element says "where".  This method is your native
method.  All groups not fetched with this method are foreign groups.

For instance, if the `news.somewhere.edu' NNTP server is where you
want to get your daily dosage of news from, you'd say:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.somewhere.edu"))

If you want to read directly from the local spool, say:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))

If you can use a local spool, you probably should, as it will almost
certainly be much faster.  But do not use the local spool if your
server is running Leafnode (which is a simple, standalone private news
server); in this case, use `(nntp "localhost")'.

If this variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the `NNTPSERVER'
environment variable.  If that variable isn't set, Gnus will see
whether `gnus-nntpserver-file' (`/etc/nntpserver' by default) has any
opinions on the matter.  If that fails as well, Gnus will try to use
the machine running Emacs as an NNTP server.  That's a long shot,
though.

If `gnus-nntp-server' is set, this variable will override
`gnus-select-method'.  You should therefore set
`gnus-nntp-server' to `nil', which is what it is by default.

You can also make Gnus prompt you interactively for the name of an
NNTP server.  If you give a non-numerical prefix to `gnus' (i.e., `C-u
M-x gnus'), Gnus will let you choose between the servers in the
`gnus-secondary-servers' list (if any).  You can also just type in the
name of any server you feel like visiting.  (Note that this will set
`gnus-nntp-server', which means that if you then `M-x gnus' later in
the same Emacs session, Gnus will contact the same server.)

However, if you use one NNTP server regularly and are just interested
in a couple of groups from a different server, you would be better
served by using the `B' command in the group buffer.  It will let you
have a look at what groups are available, and you can subscribe to any
of the groups you want to.  This also makes `.newsrc' maintenance much
tidier.  *Note Foreign Groups::.

A slightly different approach to foreign groups is to set the
`gnus-secondary-select-methods' variable.  The select methods listed
in this variable are in many ways just as native as the
`gnus-select-method' server.  They will also be queried for active
files during startup (if that's required), and new newsgroups that
appear on these servers will be subscribed (or not) just as native
groups are.

For instance, if you use the `nnmbox' back end to read your mail, you
would typically set this variable to

     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnmbox "")))

Note: the NNTP back end stores marks in marks files (*Note NNTP
marks::).  This feature makes it easy to share marks between several
Gnus installations, but may slow down things a bit when fetching new
articles.  *Note NNTP marks::, for more information.




File: gnus, Node: The First Time, Next: The Server is Down, Prev: Finding the News, Up: Starting Up

The First Time
==============

If no startup files exist (*Note Startup Files::), Gnus will try to
determine what groups should be subscribed by default.

If the variable `gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups' is set, Gnus will
subscribe you to just those groups in that list, leaving the rest
killed.  Your system administrator should have set this variable to
something useful.

Since she hasn't, Gnus will just subscribe you to a few arbitrarily
picked groups (i.e., `*.newusers').  ("Arbitrary" is defined here as
whatever Lars thinks you should read".)

You'll also be subscribed to the Gnus documentation group, which
should help you with most common problems.

If `gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups' is `t', Gnus will just use the
normal functions for handling new groups, and not do anything special.




File: gnus, Node: The Server is Down, Next: Slave Gnusae, Prev: The First Time, Up: Starting Up

The Server is Down
==================

If the default server is down, Gnus will understandably have some
problems starting.  However, if you have some mail groups in addition
to the news groups, you may want to start Gnus anyway.

Gnus, being the trusting sort of program, will ask whether to proceed
without a native select method if that server can't be contacted.
This will happen whether the server doesn't actually exist (i.e., you
have given the wrong address) or the server has just momentarily taken
ill for some reason or other.  If you decide to continue and have no
foreign groups, you'll find it difficult to actually do anything in
the group buffer.  But, hey, that's your problem.  Blllrph!

If you know that the server is definitely down, or you just want to
read your mail without bothering with the server at all, you can use
the `gnus-no-server' command to start Gnus.  That might come in handy
if you're in a hurry as well.  This command will not attempt to
contact your primary server--instead, it will just activate all groups
on level 1 and 2.  (You should preferably keep no native groups on
those two levels.) Also *Note Group Levels::.




File: gnus, Node: Slave Gnusae, Next: New Groups, Prev: The Server is Down, Up: Starting Up

Slave Gnusae
============

You might want to run more than one Emacs with more than one Gnus at
the same time.  If you are using different `.newsrc' files (e.g., if
you are using the two different Gnusae to read from two different
servers), that is no problem whatsoever.  You just do it.

The problem appears when you want to run two Gnusae that use the same
`.newsrc' file.

To work around that problem some, we here at the Think-Tank at the
Gnus Towers have come up with a new concept: "Masters" and "slaves".
(We have applied for a patent on this concept, and have taken out a
copyright on those words.  If you wish to use those words in
conjunction with each other, you have to send $1 per usage instance to
me.  Usage of the patent ("Master/Slave Relationships In Computer
Applications") will be much more expensive, of course.)

Anyway, you start one Gnus up the normal way with `M-x gnus' (or
however you do it).  Each subsequent slave Gnusae should be started
with `M-x gnus-slave'.  These slaves won't save normal `.newsrc'
files, but instead save "slave files" that contain information only on
what groups have been read in the slave session.  When a master Gnus
starts, it will read (and delete) these slave files, incorporating all
information from them.  (The slave files will be read in the sequence
they were created, so the latest changes will have precedence.)

Information from the slave files has, of course, precedence over the
information in the normal (i.e., master) `.newsrc' file.

If the `.newsrc*' files have not been saved in the master when the
slave starts, you may be prompted as to whether to read an auto-save
file.  If you answer "yes", the unsaved changes to the master will be
incorporated into the slave.  If you answer "no", the slave may see
some messages as unread that have been read in the master.

New Groups
==========

If you are satisfied that you really never want to see any new groups,
you can set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `nil'.  This will also save
you some time at startup.  Even if this variable is `nil', you can
always subscribe to the new groups just by pressing `U' in the group
buffer (*Note Group Maintenance::).  This variable is `ask-server' by
default.  If you set this variable to `always', then Gnus will query
the back ends for new groups even when you do the `g' command (*Note
Scanning New Messages::).

* Menu:

* Checking New Groups::         Determining what groups are new.
* Subscription Methods::        What Gnus should do with new groups.
* Filtering New Groups::        Making Gnus ignore certain new groups.




File: gnus, Node: Checking New Groups, Next: Subscription Methods, Prev: New Groups, Up: New Groups

Checking New Groups
-------------------

Gnus normally determines whether a group is new or not by comparing
the list of groups from the active file(s) with the lists of
subscribed and dead groups.  This isn't a particularly fast method.
If `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' is `ask-server', Gnus will ask the
server for new groups since the last time.  This is both faster and
cheaper.  This also means that you can get rid of the list of killed
groups altogether, so you may set `gnus-save-killed-list' to `nil',
which will save time both at startup, at exit, and all over.  Saves
disk space, too.  Why isn't this the default, then?  Unfortunately,
not all servers support this command.

I bet I know what you're thinking now: How do I find out whether my
server supports `ask-server'?  No?  Good, because I don't have a
fail-safe answer.  I would suggest just setting this variable to
`ask-server' and see whether any new groups appear within the next
few days.  If any do, then it works.  If none do, then it doesn't
work.  I could write a function to make Gnus guess whether the server
supports `ask-server', but it would just be a guess.  So I won't.
You could `telnet' to the server and say `HELP' and see
whether it lists `NEWGROUPS' among the commands it understands.  If
it does, then it might work.  (But there are servers that lists
`NEWGROUPS' without supporting the function properly.)

This variable can also be a list of select methods.  If so, Gnus will
issue an `ask-server' command to each of the select methods, and
subscribe them (or not) using the normal methods.  This might be handy
if you are monitoring a few servers for new groups.  A side effect is
that startup will take much longer, so you can meditate while waiting.
Use the mantra "dingnusdingnusdingnus" to achieve permanent bliss.




File: gnus, Node: Subscription Methods, Next: Filtering New Groups, Prev: Checking New Groups, Up: New Groups

Subscription Methods
--------------------

What Gnus does when it encounters a new group is determined by the
`gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method' variable.

This variable should contain a function.  This function will be called
with the name of the new group as the only parameter.

Some handy pre-fab functions are:


`gnus-subscribe-zombies'
     Make all new groups zombies.  This is the default.  You can
     browse the zombies later (with `A z') and either kill them all
     off properly (with `S z'), or subscribe to them (with `u').

`gnus-subscribe-randomly'
     Subscribe all new groups in arbitrary order.  This really means
     that all new groups will be added at "the top" of the group
     buffer.

`gnus-subscribe-alphabetically'
     Subscribe all new groups in alphabetical order.

`gnus-subscribe-hierarchically'
     Subscribe all new groups hierarchically.  The difference between
     this function and `gnus-subscribe-alphabetically' is slight.
     `gnus-subscribe-alphabetically' will subscribe new groups in a
     strictly alphabetical fashion, while this function will enter
     groups into its hierarchy.  So if you want to have the `rec'
     hierarchy before the `comp' hierarchy, this function will not
     mess that configuration up.  Or something like that.

`gnus-subscribe-interactively'
     Subscribe new groups interactively.  This means that Gnus will
     ask you about *all* new groups.  The groups you choose to
     subscribe to will be subscribed hierarchically.

`gnus-subscribe-killed'
     Kill all new groups.

`gnus-subscribe-topics'
     Put the groups into the topic that has a matching `subscribe'
     topic parameter (*Note Topic Parameters::).  For instance, a
     `subscribe' topic parameter that looks like

          "nnslashdot"

     will mean that all groups that match that regex will be
     subscribed under that topic.

     If no topics match the groups, the groups will be subscribed in
     the top-level topic.


A closely related variable is
`gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive'.  (That's quite a mouthful.)
If this variable is non-`nil', Gnus will ask you in a hierarchical
fashion whether to subscribe to new groups or not.  Gnus will ask you
for each sub-hierarchy whether you want to descend the hierarchy or
not.

One common mistake is to set the variable a few paragraphs above
(`gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method') to
`gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive'.  This is an error.  This
will not work.  This is ga-ga.  So don't do it.




File: gnus, Node: Filtering New Groups, Prev: Subscription Methods, Up: New Groups

Filtering New Groups
--------------------

A nice and portable way to control which new newsgroups should be
subscribed (or ignored) is to put an "options" line at the start of
the `.newsrc' file.  Here's an example:

     options -n !alt.all !rec.all sci.all

This line obviously belongs to a serious-minded intellectual
scientific person (or she may just be plain old boring), because it
says that all groups that have names beginning with `alt' and `rec'
should be ignored, and all groups with names beginning with `sci'
should be subscribed.  Gnus will not use the normal subscription
method for subscribing these groups.
`gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method' is used instead.  This
variable defaults to `gnus-subscribe-alphabetically'.

If you don't want to mess with your `.newsrc' file, you can just set
the two variables `gnus-options-subscribe' and
`gnus-options-not-subscribe'.  These two variables do exactly the same
as the `.newsrc' `options -n' trick.  Both are regexps, and if the new
group matches the former, it will be unconditionally subscribed, and
if it matches the latter, it will be ignored.

Yet another variable that meddles here is
`gnus-auto-subscribed-groups'.  It works exactly like
`gnus-options-subscribe', and is therefore really superfluous,
but I thought it would be nice to have two of these.  This variable is
more meant for setting some ground rules, while the other variable is
used more for user fiddling.  By default this variable makes all new
groups that come from mail back ends (`nnml', `nnbabyl',
`nnfolder', `nnmbox', `nnmh', and `nnmaildir')
subscribed.  If you don't like that, just set this variable to
`nil'.

New groups that match this regexp are subscribed using
`gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method'.




File: gnus, Node: Changing Servers, Next: Startup Files, Prev: New Groups, Up: Starting Up

Changing Servers
================

Sometimes it is necessary to move from one NNTP server to another.
This happens very rarely, but perhaps you change jobs, or one server
is very flaky and you want to use another.

Changing the server is pretty easy, right?  You just change
`gnus-select-method' to point to the new server?

*Wrong!*

Article numbers are not (in any way) kept synchronized between
different NNTP servers, and the only way Gnus keeps track of what
articles you have read is by keeping track of article numbers.  So
when you change `gnus-select-method', your `.newsrc' file becomes
worthless.

Gnus provides a few functions to attempt to translate a `.newsrc' file
from one server to another.  They all have one thing in common--they
take a looong time to run.  You don't want to use these functions more
than absolutely necessary.

If you have access to both servers, Gnus can request the headers for
all the articles you have read and compare `Message-ID's and map the
article numbers of the read articles and article marks.  The `M-x
gnus-change-server' command will do this for all your native groups.
It will prompt for the method you want to move to.

You can also move individual groups with the `M-x
gnus-group-move-group-to-server' command.  This is useful if you want
to move a (foreign) group from one server to another.

If you don't have access to both the old and new server, all your
marks and read ranges have become worthless.  You can use the `M-x
gnus-group-clear-data-on-native-groups' command to clear out all data
that you have on your native groups.  Use with caution.

Clear the data from the current group only--nix out marks and the list
of read articles (`gnus-group-clear-data').

After changing servers, you *must* move the cache hierarchy away,
since the cached articles will have wrong article numbers, which will
affect which articles Gnus thinks are read.
`gnus-group-clear-data-on-native-groups' will ask you if you want to
have it done automatically; for `gnus-group-clear-data', you can use
`M-x gnus-cache-move-cache' (but beware, it will move the cache for
all groups).




File: gnus, Node: Startup Files, Next: Auto Save, Prev: Changing Servers, Up: Starting Up

Startup Files
=============

Most common Unix news readers use a shared startup file called
`.newsrc'.  This file contains all the information about what groups
are subscribed, and which articles in these groups have been read.

Things got a bit more complicated with GNUS.  In addition to
keeping the `.newsrc' file updated, it also used a file called
`.newsrc.el' for storing all the information that didn't fit into
the `.newsrc' file.  (Actually, it also duplicated everything in
the `.newsrc' file.)  GNUS would read whichever one of these
files was the most recently saved, which enabled people to swap between
GNUS and other newsreaders.

That was kinda silly, so Gnus went one better: In addition to the
`.newsrc' and `.newsrc.el' files, Gnus also has a file called
`.newsrc.eld'.  It will read whichever of these files that are most
recent, but it will never write a `.newsrc.el' file.  You should never
delete the `.newsrc.eld' file--it contains much information not stored
in the `.newsrc' file.

You can turn off writing the `.newsrc' file by setting
`gnus-save-newsrc-file' to `nil', which means you can delete the file
and save some space, as well as exiting from Gnus faster.  However,
this will make it impossible to use other newsreaders than Gnus.  But
hey, who would want to, right?  Similarly, setting
`gnus-read-newsrc-file' to `nil' makes Gnus ignore the `.newsrc' file
and any `.newsrc-SERVER' files, which can be convenient if you use a
different news reader occasionally, and you want to read a different
subset of the available groups with that news reader.

If `gnus-save-killed-list' (default `t') is `nil', Gnus will not save
the list of killed groups to the startup file.  This will save both
time (when starting and quitting) and space (on disk).  It will also
mean that Gnus has no record of what groups are new or old, so the
automatic new groups subscription methods become meaningless.  You
should always set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `nil' or `ask-server'
if you set this variable to `nil' (*Note New Groups::).  This variable
can also be a regular expression.  If that's the case, remove all
groups that do not match this regexp before saving.  This can be
useful in certain obscure situations that involve several servers
where not all servers support `ask-server'.

The `gnus-startup-file' variable says where the startup files are.
The default value is `~/.newsrc', with the Gnus (El Dingo) startup
file being whatever that one is, with a `.eld' appended.
If you want version control for this file, set
`gnus-backup-startup-file'.  It respects the same values as the
`version-control' variable.

`gnus-save-newsrc-hook' is called before saving any of the newsrc
files, while `gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook' is called just before
saving the `.newsrc.eld' file, and `gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook' is
called just before saving the `.newsrc' file.  The latter two are
commonly used to turn version control on or off.  Version control is
on by default when saving the startup files.  If you want to turn
backup creation off, say something like:

     (defun turn-off-backup ()
       (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t))

     (add-hook 'gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)

When Gnus starts, it will read the `gnus-site-init-file'
(`.../site-lisp/gnus-init' by default) and `gnus-init-file'
(`~/.gnus' by default) files.  These are normal Emacs Lisp files
and can be used to avoid cluttering your `~/.emacs' and
`site-init' files with Gnus stuff.  Gnus will also check for files
with the same names as these, but with `.elc' and `.el'
suffixes.  In other words, if you have set `gnus-init-file' to
`~/.gnus', it will look for `~/.gnus.elc', `~/.gnus.el',
and finally `~/.gnus' (in this order).  If Emacs was invoked with
the `-q' or `--no-init-file' options (*Note Initial Options: (emacs)Initial Options.), Gnus doesn't read
`gnus-init-file'.
