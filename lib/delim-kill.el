;;; Commentary:

;; Kill text between two delimiters, preserving structure.

;; delim-kill.el contains a single convenience function for editing
;; structured data: delim-kill. Given two characters FROM and TO, it
;; kills the text between the first occurence of FROM before point and
;; the first occurence of TO after point. FROM and TO may be
;; identical.

;; If FROM and TO are not identical, the function preserves the
;; balance between the two characters: For each FROM that is
;; encountered while looking for TO, one additional TO is required;
;; and vice versa. For example, in "{ foo X{bar} baz }", with X being
;; point and "{" and "}" as delimiters, the text "{ foo {bar} baz }"
;; will be killed, not "{ foo {bar}".

;; delim-kill is useful in programming and in editing other files with
;; structure, such as CSV or JSON. In C-style langiuages, for
;; instance, you can use it to easily kill the {}-delimited block you
;; are currently in. In a CSV file you might kill the current field,
;; regardless of where point is.

;; delim-kill was inspired by Damian Conway's course "The productive
;; programmer". Thanks!

;;; Dependencies: none.

;;; Installation:
;; Put the file anywhere in your load path, (require 'delim-kill), and
;; bind the function to a key.

;;; History:
;; 2010-05:    First release.

;;; Code:
(defun delim-kill (from-char to-char orig-point save)
  "Kill the text between two characters, preserving balance.

Kills the text between the first occurence of FROM before point
and the first occurence of TO after point, including FROM and TO.

If FROM and TO are not identical, the function preserves the
balance between the two characters: For each FROM that is
encountered while looking for TO, one additional TO is required;
and vice versa. For example, in \"{ foo X{bar} baz }\", with X
being point and \"{\" and \"}\" as delimiters, the text \" foo
{bar} baz \" will be killed, not \"bar} baz \".

If FROM and TO are identical, and point is on that character when
the function is called, it ignores that single character and
moves to the next one, in both directions.

If beginning or end of buffer are reached, the function stops and
treats point-min resp. point-max as if the character had been
found there."
